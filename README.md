# LitMod2D_2.0_package_dist_users
LitMod2D_2.0 is a tool  to unravel the thermal, compositional, density, and seismological structure of the crust and upper mantle (~400 km depth) along cross-sections by integrating geophysical and geochemical dataset in a self-consistence thermodynamic manner. It is a finite-element forward modeling approach code based on the architecture of the CAGES code (Zeyen & Fern√†ndez 1994). For a detailed description of LitMod2D the reader is referred to Afonso et al. (2008) and Kumar et al. (2019).
