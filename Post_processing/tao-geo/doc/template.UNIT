###  Sample *.UNIT file for tAo  ###
#UNIT files are used to define new Blocks in TISC and tAo (loads, faults, ...). 
#First UNIT is read from file 'project1.UNIT', 2nd 'project2'.UNIT, etc.
#The unit parameters and thickness contained in these *.UNIT files 
#is read from the routine 'read_file_unit()' in tao.c. 
#Have a look at that one to better understand how this input works.

#PARAMETER	VALUE	UNITS
#----------------------------
time		0	[Ma]	Time when this load/unit must be applied. Note  that
					'time' in each unit file must be  larger than in the
					previous unit file  (projectname'N-1'.UNIT).
vel		0	[km/My]	Velocity (positive means rightwards, towards positive x).
time_stop	9999	[My]	Time to stop the load/unit.
density		2800	[kg/m3]	Density of this load/unit.
erodibility	100e3	[m]	Erodability of the unit.


#Unit properties [0=NO, 1=YES]:
gradual 	0	[0/1]	To distribute loading until the next load time.
hidden		0	[0/1]	To hide the load.
move		0	[0/1]	To move the load with 'vel_x,vel_y' (km/Ma)  till
					'Time_stop' (Ma). 
fault		0	[0/1]	Means that x-y points refer to the base of a  fault
					moving at a constant velocity  vel_x,vel_y (km/Ma) until
					'Time_stop'.  'thickness' is here the depth of the  fault in
					absence of isostatic  movements (depth the fault would have 
					at the initial time).
ride		0	[0/1]	To let the previous overlaying Blocks be dragged  by the
					present one.
cut_Blocks	0	[0/1]	Means that previously defined Blocks should be cut by
					this new fault.
cut_Block	0		If nonzero, this number minus 1 will be the  Block to cut by
					this fault. You are required to add 1  to the Block number
					so that you can cut the lowermost  Block (number 0). Block
					number as in the internal registry shown at the end of
					each   run, not the order of the user-specified units. If
					negative, it will take the  absolute value as a density and
					cut  the largest Block with that density.  
cut_all 	0	[0/1]	Means that all Blocks should be cut by this new fault.
cut_seds	0	[0/1]	Means that all sediment Blocks will be cut by this new
					fault.
thin_sheet	0	[0/1]	Calculate the deformation of this Block with a  thin
					viscous sheet (Bird, 1991).  Assumes local isostasy.
insert		0	[0/1]	Do not put this load on the top of the Blocks,  but
					insert it as the lowest load
top		0	[0/1]	Put this load on the top of the Blocks, but as  the highest
					load.
topoest		0	[0/1]	To define a topographic load, i.e., the final  (real)
					topography is given in the UNIT file and the  subsidence
					required to compensate it is calculated  (the space between
					0 and the deflection is filled  with a Block of 'densinfill'
					density). This is  equivalent to  switch_topoest=1 in the
					parameters file. Doesn't make  sense using this for moving
					or thrust  loads.
#fill_up_to	0	[m]	If present, tAo fills with constant density up  to the given
					height [m]. Distribution  will not be read.

z_default	0	[m]	Default thickness in the nodes where it is not  specified.
add_random	0	[z-units] Add random number to z between +- that value.
z_absol		0	[0/1]	For faults, 0 means z values are relative to initial
				zero (current deflection will be added to z values);  1 means
				they will be used as absolute values.

#Thickness or faut-depth distribution:
x1      z1
x2      z2
x3      z3
#...
#Attention: x3>x2>x1. tAo will linearly interpolate between the given points.
#z1, z2, z3 can represent load thickness (>0) or fault depth in case of a fault 
#type of unit (then positive downwards, measured from the z=0 datum)
