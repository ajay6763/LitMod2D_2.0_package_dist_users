	-v[<num>/<vel>]

  Options:
	'project' is the root name for the project files (i.e., if
		project=test then the parameters file should be test.PRM and
		the first load test1.UNIT.
	'-A' Switches gravity calculations on (1 for Bouguer; 2 for Free Air).
 	'-B' Sets boundary conditions type (0 to 5, see template.PRM

		'project.all'). Put this option always *after* the project
		name in the command.
	'-f' Reformats the parameters file 'project.PRM' according to the
		present version (using 'template.PRM'). Writes to stnd. output.
		Add '2' to shorten.
	'-h' To show this information file. Append 'p' to print the default
		parameters file in stdout; 'c' to print a clean version of it.
		'u' to print an example of load file; 'i' (default) to print
		this help file.
	'-M' Sets the plate model. (0 to 6, see isost_model parameter
		template.PRM). Add 't' to supress accounting for stress
		history.
	'-m' Sets the boundary moment applied at left boundary. >0 means

 	'-N' Sets the number of lateral gridding points (Nx).
 	'-o' Redirects standard output to file projectname.out.
	'-P' To produce a postscript graphic display using GMT. Append c to

2.- INTRODUCTION
    The program 'tAo' is designed to calculate the interaction between
  lithospheric flexure , tectonic loading [e.g., by thrusting], and surface
  transport [erosion/deposition]. The code puts a particular enphasis on the
  formation of foreland basin systems.
    tAo can be used as a 2D lithospheric flexure numerical model, that is, a 
  program to simulate the mechanical behavior of the lithosphere when  forces
  act on it. tAo allows to apply different rheological behaviours for the 
  lithospheric plate:
  	  .Pure Elastic.
  	  .Viscoelastic.
  	  .Depth&temperaure-dependent elastic-plastic rheology.

    tAo can calculate the deflection due to multiple loads along the time using
  elastic, viscoelastic or elasto-plastic deformation models. Sedimentation and
  erosion simple models are implemented and sea water load is considered. 
  Sediments and loads are recorded and moved as 'Blocks'.
    Different boundary conditions are predefined for several cases: trench,
  foreland basin, seamount... Lateral loads related with tectonic horizontal
  forces are also accounted for.
    Results are displayed with GMT and written to output files.
    Please, read Garcia-Castellanos et al. (1997) and Garcia-Castellanos (2007)
  for more details and some explained examples of this program.

    tAo also allows to apply different erosion models in combination with
  simple approaches to the kinematics of fault deformation in the upper crust.


  THIS PROGRAM IS PARTICULARLY DESIGNED TO:
    .To calculate lithospheric flexure directly from the lithospheric
    stratification and load distribution (option -Q).
    .To model foreland basin formation and the large-scale sedimentary infill
    geometries.
    .To solve simple 1D flexural problems in other geological contexts such
    as trenches, seamounts, etc.
    .Also to be used externally (from a unix script) as a flexure calculator,
    as part of a broader job.
    .To calculate surface processes (erosion/sedimentation) in 1D.


  THIS PROGRAM ASSUMES THAT:
    .The lithosphere behaves as a thin plate with either pure elastic (Turcotte
    & Schubert, 1982), viscoelastic (Nadai, 1963) or
    depth-dependent-elastic-plastic (Burov & Diament, 1995) behavior.
    .Sedimentation occurs either as a diffusive process or at a constant rate
    in sea floor.
    .Erosion occurs as a diffusive process or at a rate linearly-dependent on
    height.
    .The weight of the load at every point is either explicitly known, or it is
    a consequence of well-known thrust kinematics. Therefore, other processes
    posibly generating loading during orogen formation (such as lithospheric
    mantle thickening, subduction, etc) are not calculated and must be defined
    as 'hidden loads' when needed.


  THIS PROGRAM ALLOWS TO:
    .Calculate the deflection of the lithosphere due to vertical and horizontal
    tectonic loads.
    .Apply simple non-instantaneous erosion and sedimentation models to the
    topography.
    .Define multiple loads along time with different densities. .Define moving
    loads with constant velocity to calculate the related evolution of
    subsidence.
    .Calculate the load directly from a fault geometry and the shortening
    velocity.
    .Calculate the equivalent elastic thickness (EET) as a function of the
    crustal geometry and the thermal state using realistic depth- dependent
    rheology (Burov & Diament, 1995).
    .Calculate the differential stress distribution in the lithosphere
    accounting for the depth-dependent yield stress envelope (YSE) (Lynch &
    Morgan, 1987).

3.- PROGRAM STRUCTURE AND COMPILATION
  tAo is written in C under Linux.
  Check the file ./tao/README for details on compilation.
  The main source code file is src/tao.c, description of variables use 
  in file include/tao.h. 
  Check the FAQ section below in this document.
  tAo requires GMT4 to generate graphic output. 


4.- USER GUIDE - HOW TO SETUP YOUR OWN PROJECT
  See the examples in tao/demo!
  Experiment with the shell scripts in tao/scripts to see what plots can
  be made from the output files.
  tAo can be used as a quick flexural calculator using option -Q.
  Otherwise, tAo normally reads a set of input files that form a
  'project'. Input files start with a common project name and have an
  uppercase extension and are explained below, in section 'INPUTS'.  The
  main input file is the *.PRM file, which contains the main parameters
  of the project.  
  The program then enters a time loop. At each time step the tectonic motion,
  hydrology, erosion, and isostasy, are calculated. 
  Signal meaning during execution:
	l    calculating new load.
	b    defining new Block.
	e/s  calculating erosion/sedimentation.
	ft   calculating fluvial transport.
	e    calculating elastic deflection.
	v    calculating viscoelastic deflection.
  By the end of the run tao invoques a shell script to produce the 
  postscript image of the results, using the system call
  'tao.gmt.job projectname'.
  This script tao.gmt.job is searched in your path, so if you prefer any
  other of the figure scripts available in tao/script,  just link it or
  copy it to your project directory as 'tao.gmt.job'.


5.- INPUTS
	Input files are named with an uppercase extension. Inputs are read 
	sequentially from: (a) parameters file 'project.PRM', (b) command line 
	options, (c) other input files named 'project.*' (files starting with the 
	project name with an uppercase extension), and (d) from the 'project.all' 
	file when -F option is used.  (b) values override (a);  (c) overrides (a) and
	(b);  (d) overrides all. Default units are I.S. 

  'project.PRM' 
	Parameters file:
	This file is compulsory unless using the -Q option. The parameter values
	defined  in it can be also changed with the command line options listed
	above. 'tao/doc/template.PRM' file is an explained example containing
	the default parameter values. The internal use of each parameter is
	also somewhat explained in the incude file 'tao.h'.

  'projectN.UNIT'
	File modifying the geometry/architecture of the model setup (adds 
	tectonic Blocks, vertical loads, moving blocks, faults, etc):
	'N' is the number of this load: The first load file should be named 
	'project1.UNIT'. The time of each UNIT ('doc/template.UNIT') must 
	increase with 'N'. 
	The file 'doc/template.UNIT' is an explained example.
	Or type 'tao -hu' to get that file in the screen.
	tAo deformation consists of moving predefined blocks of prescribed 
	velocity and geometry by an entire number of cells at each time step. 
	The minimum shift is either 0 or 1 cells. If your time step dt is 0.5 
	Myr, velocity is 5 km/Myr and cell size is 10 km, the block will move 
	only once every 4 time steps. So, depending on the grid cell size, the 
	motion will become more or less abrupt. 

  'project.ZINI'
	Initial height (optional):		
	Similar format.


  Lithosphere rigidity or elastic thickness (for the isostaticcalcualtions) 
  can be entered in 4 ways: 1) Constant EET provided in *.PRM; 2) Laterally 
  varying EET defined in *.EET; 3) EET calculated from an input yield stress 
  envelope in *.YSE; and 4) EET calculated from the temperature distribution
  in the lithospheric plate and the crustal geoemtry (*.TMP, *.CRUST, *.UCRUST)
  as in Garcia-Castellanos et al. (2002, Tectonics). 1) and 2) apply only when 
  isost_model=1,2. 3) and 4) apply for isost_model>=3. 

  'project.EET'
	Elastic thikness file (optional, defaults to default_Te parameter, 
      see *.PRM file). Also used as initial Te for the multilayered plate case.
      The file format is:

	x1	thickness1
	x2	thickness2
	x3	thickness3
	...
	
	With: x3>x2>x1. 

  'project.YSE'
	YSE file (only in case isost_model>=2; overrides YSE calculations using 
	temperature). Format (note different units relative to the output file
	*.ysen):

	z1[m]	yieldcompres1[Pa]	yieldextens1[Pa]
	z2	yieldcompres2   	yieldextens2
	z3	yieldcompres3   	yieldextens3
	...	...

  'project.TMP'
	Temperature file (only in case isost_model>=2). If a YSE input file is 
	given, then this TMP file is ignored.
	
	x1[m]	#this x is optional, if not present, only one geotherm will be 
		#read 
	z1[m]	temperature1[C]	#(z is depth, positive downwards)
	z2	temperature2
	z3	temperature3
	...	...
	x2[m]	#x location for the second geotherm
	z1[m]	temperature1[C]
	z2	temperature2
	
	If a single number is read in a line, it will be taken as the x
	position for the z-T geotherm listed below, and then additional
	geotherms at other  x locations can be supplied. Temperature will be
	linearly interpolated  (laterally and in depth) in between them.

  'project.CRUST'
	Crust thickness. Used only if *.TMP is provided. If this file is not 
	present, then the parameter 'crust' in *.PRM will be adopted (constant
	along x).
	Similar format.

  'project.UCRUST'
	Upper crust thickness Used only if *.TMP is provided. If this file is not 
	present, then the parameter 'ucrust' in *.PRM will be adopted (constant
	along x).
	Similar format.

  'project.SLV'
	Sea and erosion/sedimentation levels along time file (optional):
	Format:

	time1	level1	[eroslevel1]
	time2	level2
	time3	level3	[eroslevel2]
	...	...	[...]

  'project.WINI'
	Initial deflection file (optional):
	Similar format. Positive deflection downwards.

  'project.REC'
	Horizon recording time file (optional, defaults to an interval of 
	dt_record, defined in the *.PRM file):
	Format:

	time1
	time2
	time3
	...

  'project.CMP'
	An x-z file to be compared with results (optional):	
	The results with real profiles digitized in this file.
	This file is not used by tAo but by the GMT job 'tao.gmt.job' which pro-
	duces a postscript image of it.
	Similar format (two columns) but x is expected in km (z in m).

    All these files are interpolated (except the .CMP one) and accept comment 
  lines to be inserted everywhere. These lines will be simply ignored when two 
  floats cannot be read in them. Attention: x3>x2>x1. tAo will linearly 
  interpolate between the given points.




6.- OUTPUTS
    Ouputs are wroten to files that start with the project name with an
  lowercase extension. Please be careful because all these files are
  removed when running again the same project with tAo. Note that x units
  in the output files are in km.

  'project.xzt'   An output file with the deflection and the topography at each
			  loading event is wroten.
  'project.pfl'   A final profile of the model containing the final model
			  geometry (elevation of the top and bottom of each
			  Block, from basament to surface).
  'project.eros'  Erosion (>0) and sedimentation (<0) at each position. Note
			  that eah value is the result of adding the thickness
			  of eros/sedim at each time step at that particular
			  location. A final  value of 1000 m of erosion) may be
			  the  result of 1000 m deposition + 2000 m erosion.
			  Besides, this is recorded where it happened, so the
			  values of eros./sedim. are not shifted with the
			  movement of the sediment or mother rock units.
  'project.xg'    A file with the gravity anomaly.
  'project.ps'    Some postscript graphics with results are made with GMT if
			  'switch_ps' is turned on.
  'project.ysen'  Calculated yield stress envelope and stress distribution at
			  the maximum moment point. Only if a multilayered
			  plate was selected (isost_model>2).
  'project.strs'  Stress distribution (also only if isost_model>2).
  'project.temp'  Temperature distribution within lithosphere (only
			  isost_model>2 and with swith_verbose=1).
  'project.eeth'  Elastic thickness distribution resulting calculated when
			  isost_model>2. If this file is present and the
			  default Te value is a signal '-1', then this '*.eeth'
			  file is used as the initial value of the
			  moment-curvature iteration.
  'project.all'   Binary file to be read when the model is going to be resumed
			  (continued) with option '-F'.



7.- GRAPHIC OUTPUT
  'project.ps'
    A multipage postscript produced with GMT 4.0 software (Wessel & Smith,
    1995, http://www.soest.hawaii.edu/soest/gmt.html) (using a unix script:
    'tao.gmt.job'), with graphics of all the results of tAo:
      .Distribution of loads/units/sediment and the deflected basament compared 
      with the 'project.CMP' file if it exists.
      .Bouguer gravity anomaly and geoid anomaly if requested.
      .Stress distribution when rheological considerations have been requested.
      .Yield stress envelope and stress distribution at the maximum moment
      point.
    The GMT and shell commands generating this image are always searched by tAo
    in a file named tao.gmt.job in the user's path. The original is located at
    tao/script, so put that directory in your path. If you want to change the
    graphic output then make a copy of it in your current project directory and
    tAo will find it first there (if '.' is placed before tao/script in your
    path. You can also use a symbolic link to any of the other scripts in the
    tao/script directory. Do experiment.


8.- THE CONCEPTUAL MODEL
    Take a look at Garcia-Castellanos et al., 1997, 2007.
    The conceptual model assumes the classical thin plate approach (Turcotte &
  Schubert, 1982) with either pure elastic (Turcotte & Schubert, 1982),
  viscoelastic (Nadai, 1963) or depth-dependent-elastic- plastic rheology
  (Burov & Diament, 1995) to calculate the lithosphere deflection by loading.
    Loading can be either directly defined or modeled using fault propagation
  systems produced by crustal shortening. The produced topography is then
  eroded and the areas subsided below sea level are infilled with sediments,
  which timing and geometry are recorded. Another possibility is to know the
  topography but ignore the internal geometry of the thrust-loads. In this
  situation one can assume that the topography has a constant density and stays
  at zero level, finding the deflection (filled up with a constant density
  'densinfill') necessary to explain that topograpgy. This is done when
  'switch_topoestable' is turned on (signal 'T' appears in the load file); the
  load file is then taken as the topography.
    Appart from these well-defined loads, other forces such as tectonic
  horizontal force, vertical force at the boundary and moment at the boundary,
  are taken into account.
    The surface process model includes river incision and transport allowing 
  four different source-limited, transport -limited, an hybrid approaches. It
  assumes that the modeling profile corresponds to the main river of the 
  region, which basin has a width defined by the parameter riverbasinwidth. 
  Precipitation in a node is extrapoalted to the basin width to increase discharge.
  Evaporation in lakes is extrapoalted to riverbasinwidth to reduce discharge.
  Erosion along the river channel is extrapolated to the entire basin width.
  Sedimentation is extrapoalted to riverbasinwidth to reduce sed. load.



9.- ALGORITHMS AND NUMERICAL METHODS
  Finite differences are used to solve the spatial partial differential
    equations as well as the time-dependent processes.
  Matrices arising from the diferential equations are solved using a classical
    band solver.
  Gravity anomaly is calculated using Talwani et al. (1959) algorithm.
  Geoid anomaly is calculated using Chapman (1979) algorithm (see also Ayala et
    al, 1996).



10.- VERSION HISTORY
  v1.0 (1993) Proto-model or numerical algorithm to calculate thin plate
    elastic and viscoelastic flexure.
  v2.0 (1994) Inclusion of moving loads and surface processes. Gravity anomaly
    calculations.
  v3.0 (1995) Multilayered elastic-plastic rheology. Geoid anomaly
    calculations.
  v3.2 (1996) Inclusion of thrust loading and sediment deformation. Command-
    line options.
  v3.21(1997) Allows sea_level variations along time. Allows erosion/sedimen-
    tation variations along time.
  v3.3 (1998) Stress history is accounted for.
  v3.4 (1999) Change in param. file keeping compatibility with v3.3. Parameters
    are now read in any order and non of them is required in the '.PRM' file.
    This will allow to keep compatibility easily in future versions. Moreover,
    now is possible to resume a model that was stopped, which will allow more
    freedom to change parameters during execution avoiding new input files
    (option -F). Option 'c' in loads to cut Blocks with faults (works better
    than 'C'.
  v4.0 (2002) Fluvial sediment transport. Loads and faults now defined in
    *n.UNIT input files (instead of *n.CRG) file, and the file accepts now
    a list of parameters for the new Block. Files *.H0 and *.W0 are now
    called *.ZINI and *.WINI, respectively.
    (2004) Orographic precipitation implemented following a conservative
    scheme  (runoff=precipitation-evaporation).
    (2005) A memory bug solved in surface_transport (this was producing
    NaN results in a quite unpredictable manner).
  tAo_2006-11-02 Removed bugs in -Q mode, now pressure is entered instead of
    thickness.
  tAo_2009-12-07 Additional erosion models implemented.
  tAo_2012-08-29
    Change in output extensions that differ from inputs only in their case,
    auch as '*.eet' -> '*.eeth' and '*.yse' -> '*.ysen'. This is to avoid
    conflict in Mac computers. Successfully compiled for Mac IOS 10.7.5
    Solved bug during -F (project resume) option.
  tAo_2014-09-21
    Erosion models 6 and 7.
    Graphic scripts now distiguish old sediment in cross section.
    Improved sediment deformation. 'deform_sed' parameter added. Sediment above 
    moving Blocks is transported and piled in front. 
    Change in units of precipitation and sed. load. Incorporation of 
    riverbasinwidth
  tAo_2017-05-19
    Average erodibility is now calculated for the shallowest meters of bedrock.
    Erosion boundary conditions 0 and 1 are swapped.
    -v command line option to change velocity of Blocks based on density.
    Changed UNIT1D and Units structure to BLOCK1D and Blocks, to avoid confusion 
	with input files (UNITS). 
  tAo_
	Gradual sediment compaction now implemented (see
	new parameter compact_depth). 
  

11.- MODEL LIMITATIONS
      Blocks move only an entire number of nodes at each time step. Block
    deformation during motions follows a vertical shear approach
    (preserving vertical thickness). Rotation of Blocks is not allowed.
      tAo doesn't account for deformation in lower crust or mantle, and the
    deformation in the upper crust (by shortening) is kinematically
    introduced in the model. Subduction is not considered either. Different
    velocities of shortening for each detachment fault are (still) not
    implemented.
      Gradual sediment compaction is not considered, but this shouldn't affect 
    the sediment onlap/offlap geometry in the external side of the foreland
    basin, but only the thickness of the Blocks.
      Grain size or sediment facies distribution of predicted deposits are
    not differentiated.


12.- FAQ - Frequently Asked Questions
  Q1. How can I manage to learn to use this code on my own?
  A1. After download, follow instructions in tao/doc/README file in order to
	compile. Then go to tao/demo and try the examples there to ensure that
	the code is working properly. Then read carefully tao/doc/tao.info.txt
	(this file) and  tao/doc/template.PRM and try to experiment modifying
	the *.PRM files of the demos. Then learn how to build *.UNIT input
	files from the examples and using the explanations in
	tao/doc/tao.info.txt. Make sure you did all this before  contacting the
	author!
  Q2. I have errors in the compilation, is there a problem in the program?
  A2. I tested tAo only in some UNIX operative systems such as Linux (Ubuntu),
	Mac OSX 10, and Solaris (from SUN). Most probably you have a problem
	with the  compilation options or with the libraries. Try to ask help
	among your colleagues to succeed in the compilation.
  Q3. I compiled the program, but I never managed to run it, and always I
  	get 'segmentation fault' errors.
  A3. This means you have some incompatibility between some of the functions
	called in tAo and the ones available in the libraries of your
	operative  system. You have to edit the code and search or those
	problems.  You will need the help of someone around you who have
	experience  in programing and/or in compiling C programs.
  Q4. Can you help me to solve the problems I have to run tAo?
  A4. In general, I try to answer the questions you send by email, but usually
	i cannot say much more than what you just read in this file.
	Unfortunately, I can not provide you a close technical  support on the
	compilation process, but this has a good side: you get this program for
	free. Because my interests are in the scientific use of tAo and its
	application to geological scenarios, I will be pleased to help you with
	any problem you have during the  development of a model and will be
	pleased to stablish a scientific colaboration.
  ON UNIT DEFINITION:
  Q5. Is it possible to stop a fault and then reactivate it again?
  A5. You can stop a fault at a given time by using the time_stop
  	parameter in the *.UNIT file.  To reactivate it, repeate the
  	same fault geometry in another *.UNIT file with the velocity you
  	wish.  Use tao -hu to get the possible parameters in every
  	*.UNIT file.

13.- GLOSSARY
  Hidden load
	Flexural models in foreland basins have assumed that subsidence is due
	only to the weight of the topographic load (i.e., load is proportional
	to height). This assumption ignores other processes (subduction,
	lithospheric mantle thickening, plate interaction forces, etc.) leading
	to the need of additional loads to fit the observed deflection. These
	are refered in the literature as hidden loads. Stockmal & Beaumont
	(1986) suggested that one of the reasons for this could be the
	existence of a depth bathymetry before plate colission, which would
	produce important deflections even when topography was still not
	produced. tAo includes the posibility of introducing initial
	bathimetry/topography and therefore allows to avoid these source of
	hidden loads. If you still need an extra load to explain the
	deflection, then you have to define it as a file load with the 'hidden'
	label ('H') so that it will not increase topography.

  Project
	Group of input files corresponding to a work project. All files must
	begin with same single word stored in the char variable 'project'.

  Switch
	Variables names starting with 'switch_' correspond to Boolean type
	switches with values true or false (1 or 0) and are used to turn on and
	off options of the model.

  switch_topoestable
	This is a variable-parameter switch that strongly affects the
	conceptual modeling. When its value is 0 the load read from file will
	lay on the basement and will subside (deflect) with it. When its value
	is 1 the read load will stay at zero level and the space between the
	deflected basement and the zero will be filled up with a constant
	density 'densinfill'. This second way is often used in the literature
	and strongly simplifies the modeling, but it avoids to consider the
	internal geometry of the orogen.

  Topographic load
	This is a type of load (see load input file format) that, when loaded,
	remains on the top of the profile and neither it nor the whole profile
	subsides: only the basement, and the space created is filled with a
	'densinfill' density material. See 'switch_topoestable' entry.

  Unit
	Input files (*.UNIT) described above to provide the geometry of faults or
	loads. Units are converted into internal 'Blocks' after being read.

  Blocks
	Blocks are 'bodies' written in *.hrz and listed in the screen output. 
	They are generally more numerous than the units because they include 
	the sedimentary blocks calculated by tAo. T
	A Block corresponds in the code with a 2D body (a sediment Block,
	thrusting Block, an instantaneous load or whatever), with a density, 
	velocity, age and thickness profile associated. Internally, this is 
	stored in a C-language structure called 'Blocks' and a summary of 
	these Blocks is written to the standard output at the end of the run.

  YSE
	Stands for Yield Stress Envelope. Curve defining the maximum stress
	that can occur at each depth.
