tAo is a C program for Linux to calculate the flexure of the lithosphere and, 
more in general, to numerically simulate the formation of foreland basins in 
pseudo 2D (vertical cross section). 
The pseudo 3D version of tAo is called TISC and distributed apart.

TO INSTALL tAo:

tAo has been developed in C under Linux, and is ready for compilation in a Mac 
Linux environment.

-Uncompress the downloaded file in a directory 'tao/'.

-Check the compiling options in 'tao/config.mk'.

-Compile typing 'make' in the main directory. This will create the executable 
tao in the bin/ directory. You should put tao/bin/ and tao/script/ in your path
and define the tao_dir variable in your environment.

-Preferably install GMT 4 (free-ware software, used for graphic output) and put 
its bin/ directory in your path. This should work:
	sudo apt-get update
	sudo apt-get install gmt ksh csh tofrodos

-Try examples of how to run tAo in the directory 'tao/demo/'. This will allow
you to be sure that the code is working properly. Check that the graphic
output is correctly produced in the postscript output files (*.ps).


-Read the 'doc/tao.info.txt' file to know more about how to use tAo.
