This file contains instructions to run some examples of tAo. The aim of these
examples is to check that your installation of tAo is actually working and to 
show that tAo is able to address a diversity of geological problems 
and contexts. The examples are sorted from  the most general and simple
problems (example_A) to the most detailed and  specific about foreland basin
formation (example_E).
All Postscripts in these directories are the result of the tao.gmt.job GMT
commands script, which is automatically invoqued when the parameter switch_ps =
1.

EXAMPLES: 
You can check and modify the inputs (files with an upppercase name extension).

*example_A:
	Suppose you need to calculate the deflection of a 20-km-thick 
elastic plate under a point load of 1e12 N/m on its left edge (x=0), where 
no moment is supported. The next command solves this problem using 31 points 
of discretization in the finite differences method:
	Command:	tao -Q -V -N31 -s1e12 -B1 -D0/300e3 -T20e3
	Note that in this example you don't use any input-output file. 
Output is printed in the standar output in 3 columns: x(km), deflection(m), 
load_pressure(Pa).


*example_B:
	Suppose you know the density and the lateral variation of the thickness
of a body laying on the lithosphere (the load of a volcanic seamount, for 
example). You have these data in the file example_B_load and you want to know 
the deflection along x produced in the region ranging from x=0 to x=1000 km 
assuming that the boundaries of the domain are far enough from the load so that 
they are not deflected. Moreover, a compressive tectonic horizontal force 
of 1e12 N·m is acting.
	Command:	tao -Qexample_B_load -N51 -B2 -p1e12 -D0/1000e3
	Note that in this example you don't get any output file, deflection is
just flushed to the standar output as in example_A. The maximum load resulting 
from the input load is 88e6 Pa at x=540 km.


*example_C:
	Let's call this project 'example_C'; this will be the begining of all
the input and output file names. I this example, two triangular shaped  loads
are loaded gradually from t=0 to t=10 Ma, producing a time dependent  evolution
of the deflection as given in the output file 'example_C.xzt'.  This case would
be similar to a volcano formation in the middle of an  oceanic plate. Gravity
(Bouguer) and geoid anomalies are also calculated,  written to 'example_C.xg'
and displayed in 'example_C.ps'. 
	Command:	tao example_C
	Note that you could also change the parameter densenv=1000 (density of 
water), so the effective bouyancy contrast density would be 3300-1000 rather 
than 3300 (density of mantle). This would indicate that we were assuming an
oceanic environment in this example, and then you should turn off the sea 
switch (switch_sea=0), since sea is no longer accounted for explicitly as a 
load.
	Use this example to understand the topoest parameter by running: 
	Command:	tao example_C -qswitch_topoest=0 -tf5
	Command:	tao example_C -qswitch_topoest=1 -tf5


*example_D:
	This example corresponds to example 1 of the paper in Computers & 
Geosciences (1997, v. 23, 9, pp. 993-1003). The geometry of the sedimentary 
infill produced during a  foreland basin formation is studied. 
	Command:	tao example_D


*example_E:
	This example corresponds to example 2 of the paper in Computers & 
Geosciences (1997). Similar to example_D but an elastic-plastic model is
assumed  which allows to predict a more realistic stress distribution in the 
lithosphere. It incorporates rheological stratification and lateral and depth 
dependency of the yield stress. 
	Command:	tao example_E


*example_F:
	This consists of a job that runs a tao model in several stages (using 
the -F option) changing some parameters during the run. Edit the job for 
details.
	Command:	example_F.job


*example_G:
	Simple setup to play with the compaction of sediment 
	tao example_G -qsed_porosity=.5 -qcompact_depth=2000 -T5e3 


*Example run incorporating surface transport:
	Go into doc/surface_transport directory and run:
	Command:	tao margin


*Tonga: The run publlished in Geophys. J Intl., 2000, on the Tonga and Kermadec 
Trenches:
	Go into doc/Tonga directory and run:
	Command:	tao Tonga
