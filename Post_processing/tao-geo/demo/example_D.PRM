This project intends to show the
effect of previous stretching in the
foreland basin formation.


LABEL or   	PARAMETER  
VARIABLE  	VALUES    	USE
---------  	----------	--------------------------------------------

version	tAo_2006-11-02	Version will be matched when starting tao.


Gridding:
Nx		801 	Number of x points (distance axis).

Limits of x domain:
x0		000e3	Left
xf		800e3	Right

Limits of the output window:
xmin		130e3	Left
xmax		350e3	Right
zmin		-8000	Bottom
zmax		3000	Top


Lithospheric plate geometry:
Te		20000	Default Elastic Thickness (if no .EET file). Te=0 => local isostasy.
zini 		0	Altitude of the initial plate position from sea level.
random_topo	0


Densities:
densmantle	3250	Density of the fluid material beneath the plate (at the compensation level: either mantle or asthenosphere). 
denscrust	2950	Crust (just for anomaly calculation).
denssedim	2200	Sediments.
densenv 	0	Air (or water for oceanic flexure).


isost_type	1	To switch the thinplate model of lithosphere:
			#0: No flexure performance.
			#1: Pure elastic plate model.
			#2: Visco-elastic plate model.
			#3: Elastic-plastic oceanic lithosphere.
			#4: Elastic-plastic continental always decoupled.
			#5: Elastic-plastic continental never decoupled.
			#6: Elastic-plastic continental auto. decoupling.


Boundary Conditions Type:
boundary_conds	1	#0: Left edge is the center of a simmetric model and the plate is not broken there. Right edge is free.
			#1: Broken plate at left with external force 'appshearforce' and moment 'appmoment' at the left edge. Right edge is free (zero values).
			#2: 0 dip and 0 deflection at left and right edges.
			#3: Free edges (0 moment and 0 vertical shear stress).
			#4: Hunging plate with fixed edges and 0 moment.
			#5: Broken plate at right with external force 'appshearforce' and moment 'appmoment' at the right edge. Left edge is free (zero values).


External forces:
horz_force	0e12	Horizontal tectonic force (compressive if >0).
vert_force	-0e12	Applied force as bound. cond. in cases 1 and 5. (downwards if <0).
moment		-0e16	Torque as bound. cond. cases 1 and 5. (clockwise if >0).


Erosion model parameters (used only if switch_erosed=1):
erosed_model	1	
Kerosdif	1	Diffusive erosion constant [m2/yr].
Keroseol	.1	Continental background erosion rate constant meters of sediment by meters of height and My [m/(m·Ma)].
Ksedim  	1e2	Water sedimentation rate [m/Ma].
deform_sed	1


Time variables [Ma] (time goes from negative to positive, Timeini<Timefinal):
Timeini		0	Initial time.
Timefinal	20	Final time.
tau		5	Relaxation time (used only for the viscoelastic plate model).
dt		1	Increment time.
dtmemounit	2	Time elapsed between units recording. 
			  if = 0 only file-defined load units will be recorded. 


grav_anom	0	Gravity anomaly output type. #0: No gravity calculations; #1: Bouguer anomaly;  #2:Free-Air

These are switches to turn on options of the model.
Their possible values are 1 (yes) or 0 (no):
switch_sea	1	For existence of sea.
switch_topoest	0	To keep loads at its initial position, filling the deflection with densinfill material.	

i/o switches:
switch_files	1	For extra file output.
switch_ps	1	For postscript output.
verbose_level	0	For more runtime information.

Comments:
	This is a tAo parameter file. 
	--tao command line options are intepreted after reading this PRM file, 
	so they override these values.
	--You can modify the format of this parameter files, either by adding 
	more comment lines or changing comments in the existing lines after the 
	values. Order in parameters is not important. 
	--You only have to include theparameters which default value you want 
	to change.
	--You can run the simplest model (without any load file *.CRG) just 
	varying the b.c. parameters 'appshearforce' & 'appmoment' and the 
	'tecforce' external horizontal force. 
	--Default unities: I.S.  (except indication).
	--If  (switch_topoest != 0) then the load will rest at zero level 
	and plate subsidence will be filled with 'densinfill' material. Do not 
	use with erosion model.
	--You can get more information about the meaning of each parameter in 
	the tao.h file and tao.info file.
