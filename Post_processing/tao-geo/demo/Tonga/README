This directory contains the input files needed to run a model 
similar to that published in GJI on the Tonga Trench (Garcia-Castellanos 
et al., 2000).  Note that due to small changes in some parameters in the 
program, the forces needed to fit the bathymetry might differ slightly 
relative to that paper.

To run the project, type:
tao Tonga
